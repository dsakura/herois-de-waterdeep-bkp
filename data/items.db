The brand is curvaceous, with a single sheet of pressed, folded metal forming its entire length, all the way from its razor-sharp tip down to the bottom of its equally-keen guard. Despite its curvy shape, it isn't entirely rounded and numerous jagged notches and protrusions spring forth from it in places to ensnare unsuspecting victims. Interestingly, the purple illumination that emanates from the join between the blade's handle and guard hums quietly as if powered by some unseen power source.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Sissoro was never intended to be a mere longsword. In truth, the blade forms one half of a pair of large, ornate scissors&mdash;the weapon of choice for a very powerful witch who ruled over a large and trackless swamp. Her enemies feared her greatly and, in an act of desperation, stole Sissoro from her. However, upon securing the witch's beloved weapon, they discovered that they were unable to destroy it. Left with no other choice, they split the magical scissors in two, and hid both halves as far away from each other as they could.\"</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Weapon</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Sissoro can be used as a longsword.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Caustic Cutter</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The toxic nature of Sissoro's former mistress is revealed through its strikes.

This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p><p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d100]] (33 percent) chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"self","type":"self"},"range":{"value":0,"long":0,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"heal","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d10","necrotic"],["","healing"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":9,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"folder":"BkTF1PtvJCbPFObx","sort":11700001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/spell/phb-wish.jpg","effects":[]}

Amidst a dangerous world of crumbling chimney stacks, loose tiles, and hidden hazards, the utility that this ornate gauntlet provides in aiding its user to access and navigate rooftops more easily is significant. A simple thumbs-up causes the object's crossbow to extend, while presenting a thumbs-down signal makes the mechanism retract. Once loaded, getting it to fire is as easy as forming a fist with the wearer's thumb pinched between their index and middle fingers.

{"name":"Phantasmal Rail","permission":{"default":0,"IKZcSijaQ4XFwYDB":3,"OWUwMjUxOTE5MjE0":3},"type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><img style=\"float: right; border: 0px;\" src=\"modules/ddd-beginner-baubles/images/bb08/phantasmal-rail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"248\" height=\"256\" />\"Once belonging in the bathroom of a stately home, this gothic curtain rail has clearly not been used in some time and has long since lost its tarred canvas curtain. It was once gold plated although the gold has chipped in places, and dulled in others. Perhaps most strikingly of all, the rail appears to be steadily emitting a thin wispy fog. This vapor disperses quickly if it is disturbed or while the rail is in motion, however any time it is still, the fog coalesces to form a thin film that looks just like the canvas curtain it has lost. Sometimes a humanoid male's face appears behind the ghostly, spectral curtain for a moment, or a hand can be seen brushing against it from beyond.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Unsurprisingly, the Phantasmal Rail has a dark history. Its former owner was slaughtered getting out of the bathtub by one his adulterous wife's spurned lovers after a messy altercation, his spirit now tethered to the last thing he touched. Tragically, his trapped soul is no longer able to tell its sorry tale, reveal the identity of the person who murdered him&mdash;who is likely long since deceased themselves&mdash;, </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">or find true and lasting peace. While nothing approaching justice may be achieved in this lifetime, or perhaps the next, the addled spirit bound to the Phantasmal Rail is determined to aid the creature to which it is linked.\"</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Weapon</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Phantasmal Rail can be used as a quarterstaff.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Grasping Hands</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The ghostly presence anchored to the Phantasmal Rail is not idle in protecting the creature who safeguards its last link to the mortal coil. When you use the Phantasmal Rail to make an attack against a Medium or smaller creature and score a critical hit, a frightening spectral form bursts from the mist surrounding curtain rail. The target of the triggering attack must attempt a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened until the start of your next turn.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Shifting Temperament</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Though the ghostly presence anchored to the Phantasmal Rail works to protect the creature who bears it, its mood is fickle and liable to change quickly from benevolent to belligerent. The ghost anchored to this object is always present and can interact with the world at will. Roll a d6 each dawn and record the result. On a result of 1-2, the game master controls the ghost and it attempts to make a nuisance of itself. On a result of 3-4, the ghost does nothing. On a result of 5-6, you control the ghost. The ghost functions as per the spell </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><em>Mage Hand</em>, except </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">directing it does not cost an action. The disposition of the ghost improves or sours with your fortunes. Anytime you score a natural 20 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, a cumulative +1 bonus is added to the recorded d6 roll (max 6). Conversely, any time you roll a 1, the ghost's mood grows darker and a -1 penalty is applied to the tracked result (minimum 1).</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Macabre Manifestations</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The spirit that haunts the Phantasmal Rail frequently makes its presence known in the following ways:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">There is often an uncomfortable chill around it.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A light mist emanates from it. When the object is not in motion, this pervasive mist wraps itself into the form of the screen that once hung from it.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The distant sound of sobbing, screaming, and discordant whispers can sometimes be heard in the presence of it.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You sometimes leave bloody footprints behind you.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">It is often wet to the touch, and you often wake from sleep with wet hair.</span></li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Esoteric Charms","quantity":1,"weight":4,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Beginner Bauble","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":"0","chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d6 + @mod","bludgeoning"]],"versatile":"1d8 + @mod"},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"simpleM","properties":{"amm":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"hvy":false,"lgt":false,"lod":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"spc":false,"thr":false,"two":false,"ver":true},"proficient":false,"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"folder":"cWRjvnZeLQUNUCSA","sort":7800000,"flags":{"mess":{"templateTexture":"","isBonusDamage":false},"ddd-beginner-baubles":{"initialization-folder":"Beginner Baubles"}},"img":"modules/ddd-beginner-baubles/icons/simple-melee-weapon.png","effects":[],"_id":"BQqbYc6MOvD7FUUK"}

That structure, named after the fields of purple flowers that grew around it, was a site of tremendous religious significance until it fell into a great fissure that opened up during an earthquake many years ago. The individual depicted in the stained glass is that of the basilica's patron and first protector as he preached amongst the lisianthus flowers outside the shrine on the day of the summer solstice.

Once per day, as an action you can utter a command word while wielding it. If you do so, the shield erupts with holy light in a 15 foot cone, dazzling those who behold it. Creatures caught in the blast that can see and don't have their eyes covered must attempt a DC 8 Constitution saving throw. On a fail, they have disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. Undead creatures affected by this feature have disadvantage on their saving throw and those who fail it also take 1d4 radiant damage and are incapacitated for the duration. Additionally, the light emitted from the shield is so intense that it continues to glow for 5 minutes after this feature is activated, shedding bright light out to a distance of 10 foot and dim light a further 10 foot.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Blessed Be The Earth (1/Day)</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Just as its wielder can feel a touch of the divine lingering over them, Empyrean can also be used to bathe the ground around it in holiness. You can undertake a ritual with the shield once per day that takes 1 hour to perform. During this ritual, the shield must be laid on the ground and cannot be moved or disturbed. For 24 hours after the ritual is complete, the ground in a 30 foot cube centered on where Empyrean was placed during the ritual fills with purple flowers and is considered consecrated ground. During this time, the ground becomes difficult terrain for undead creatures and they have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws while in the affected area.

Its first, and less noteworthy, component is a leather pauldron designed to sit comfortably over its wearer&rsquo;s shoulder or armor and fasten securely in place. Affixed to this hide epaulette is an oddly-lifelike statuette of a stone gargoyle with turquoise gems for eyes. At a paltry eight inches tall while hunched, the tiny sculpture appears to be screeching, though is otherwise lifeless.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Guardgoyle is quite literally a guardian angel, albeit an unusual one.

Only the object's leather pauldron is visible until you attune to it. A small stone gargoyle appears perched on it the morning after you attune to it. Should you ever cease to be attuned to Guardgoyle, the gargoyle disappears once more. The gargoyle can also be destroyed as per Lifelife (below), in which case it must be restored through other means as described in that feature or be attuned to by a new creature that hasn't attuned to it</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">&nbsp;before.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Lifeline</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Guardgoyle does not squat idly by as its ward bleeds out beside it. When you are knocked unconscious as a result of being reduced to 0 hit points, it comes to life, takes flight, and attempts to protect you from harm to the best of its ability. The Guardgoyle continues to fight and defend you until you have stabilized and there are no longer any immediate threats to your wellbeing in your vicinity, at which time it returns to its position on your shoulder and reverts to being nothing more than an inanimate object of stone.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Rule Clarification, Guardgoyle.</strong> Statistical information necessary to use Guardgoyle in combat can be found in @Compendium[ddd-beginner-baubles.monsters.tiwrYBLZvKlmNf9i]{Guardgoyle}.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Settling Up</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Guardgoyle may be a useful and vigilant ally, but its loyalty comes with a price. Any time it is forced to animate and fight to defend you, you discover that you have lost an amount in GP equal to your level x 20 when you regain consciousness. This total can be in GP, other coinage, or objects of an equivalent value. If you don't have the funds about your person, any creature within earshot can utter the words, 'I shall pay your toll', and settle up on your behalf after the battle instead. If they do so, the GP disappears from their coinpurse or similar when you regain consciousness.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Should the gargoyle be slain or no one pay its toll, it vanishes, leaving only the Guardgoyle's leather pauldron in its place. You can resummon the gargoyle at a later date by undertaking a ritual that takes 1 hour to complete and requires you to make an offering worth your level x 50 GP.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Religious Regalia","quantity":1,"weight":6,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Beginner Bauble","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":null,"type":"clothing","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":false,"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"folder":"cWRjvnZeLQUNUCSA","sort":5200000,"flags":{"ddd-beginner-baubles":{"initialization-folder":"Beginner Baubles"}},"img":"modules/ddd-beginner-baubles/icons/clothing.png","effects":[],"_id":"UhdNRmtSOgIk18aY"}

Its exterior has lots of small buttons, dials, and switches on it, which are used to configure the device into its different modes of use. Many of these are completely unnecessary and aren't linked to any function whatsoever, as if its inventor intended on adding features to it that ultimately never saw inclusion. Though, to a creature not versed in spellcasting, even the buttons it has are perfectly redundant.\"</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Attunement Requirement</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">In order to make use of the Ley Compass' features, you must be attuned to it and able to cast at least one spell. If you do not fulfil these requirements, you can still use it as a mundane, nonmagical compass. Any effects created by the Ley Compass are considered to be a form of Conjuration magic and can be detected through Truesight or the use of spells</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Magical Marker</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Using the Ley Compass, a creature can quickly and easily find their way back to a significant location. Pressing one of its buttons causes it to create an invisible, formless magical marker in its current location. Using its other controls, you can configure it to recognise a specific marker as due north. It can maintain five such markers at once, though any attempt to exceed this number causes all of its existing magical markers to fizzle away into nothingness.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Arcane Breadcrumbs</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A creature armed with the Ley Compass has certain advantages against becoming lost. By flicking a switch on it, you can set it to deposit discrete magical waypoints every 50 foot for 1 hour. You can then use it to locate the nearest marker in whichever direction it is facing. These markers degrade after 24 hours, vanishing entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Portal Insights</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Ley Compass is linked closely with portals and teleportation circles, affording its wielder certain insights into them. Should the device be brought within 50 foot of any kind of magical portal or gateway, its surface becomes tranquil and crystal clear. Creatures on the Ley Compass' side of the portal or gateway can then peer through it and see the area where it emerges.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Additionally, while within 50 foot of a magical gateway that re-emerges elsewhere on the same plane of existence the Ley Compass is on, you can touch your current location on a map if you have one, enter a trance-like state, and trace your finger to the place in the world where the gateway leads. If it doesn't emerge within the confines of the map, you're able to trace its trajectory until you reach the edge of the map instead.</span></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Sagely Impedimenta","quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Beginner Bauble","identified":true,"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"folder":"cWRjvnZeLQUNUCSA","sort":20900000,"flags":{"ddd-beginner-baubles":{"initialization-folder":"Beginner Baubles"}},"img":"modules/ddd-beginner-baubles/icons/wondrous-item.png","effects":[],"_id":"Umx3oLTHNY6PHpJX"}

However, a creature who becomes familiar with the nature of its enchantment will quickly come to recognize its usefulness and utility as much more than a paltry scrap of discarded paper.</em></p>\n<p><em>Tamotuki is surprisingly old, much more so than a cursory inspection of it might reveal. It's extremely hardwearing and durable and has been folded into unusual shapes thousands of times. Once upon a time, the object was perfectly mundane. It came to life after it was shaped into a crane by a dying father and left for his daughter beside her bed the last time he laid eyes on her. The very next morning he was gone, but the crane he left behind seemed to be very much alive.\"</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Paper Folds</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This unassuming slip of paper is astoundingly versatile, as any who explore its seams and folds quickly discovers. As an action, you can fold Tamotuki to imitate the rudimentary shape and configuration of any Tiny object, though it is clearly only an origami replica and isn't mistaken for the genuine article without a much more elaborate ruse. The folded parchment is surprisingly strong and durable and can fulfil the same basic function as the object it is imitating, as long as that purpose is simple in nature. For example, Tamotuki cannot be used to manipulate a complicated lock's pins and tumblers while imitating a key, however it could be used as a doorstop. You can unfold it so that it returns to its flat form as an action. Tamotuki is waterproof and can be used in any of the following ways, though this list is by no means exhaustive:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as any basic piece of ammunition.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a dagger or sickle.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a cup, plate, bowl, or other tiny receptacle or container.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a paper plane or boat.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can fold it to serve as a key that opens any simple lock which can be unlocked with a DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can also fold&nbsp;</span>Tamotuki <span class=\"fontstyle0\">to loosely resemble a creature of any size, though the imitation itself is Tiny. If you fold it in such a way, the paper becomes animated and acts as per the natural instincts of </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">the creature being imitated or your psychic wishes, as long as you remain within 120 feet of it. If you move further from it, it becomes inert and crumbles to floor in a crumpled up ball.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rule Clarification, Variant Origami Folds.</strong> When Tamotuki is folded into certain forms, it gains special features.

Though rarely encountered together, each box in the set is differently sized so that they can be stacked snugly within each other. Arranged in a classic baroque style with sterling silver detailing, 24-carat gold trim, and a rich red velvet padded interior, each case that forms this magnificent collection is needlessly indulgent; as much a work of art as it is a functional receptacle for the treasured keepsakes of its owner.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">In reality, the Babushaboxes are a sham and, correctly appraised, these phony coffers are only worth a fraction of what they appear to be at face value. The sterling silver is actually silver-plated brass, the 24-carat gold instead 4-carat with a lacquer coating that masks its impurities, and the red velvet is just a cheaper felt substitute. However, the chests' real worth lies in their hidden potential and rests with whomever holds dominion over the largest box in the set.\"</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>True Value</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">To those without a keen eye for such things, the Babushaboxes appear to be exceptional, both </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">individually and as a set. Superficially, they seem like they're worth 50 GP each, or 400 GP for the complete collec</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">tion. However, a creature studying them to discern or appraise their true value should make a DC 13 Intelligence (investigation) check. On a success, they identify that the Babushaboxes are only worth a tenth of what they might have otherwise suspected.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rule Clarification, Defined Item Values. </strong>Although this feature specifies the value of the</span></span> Babushaboxes<span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">, this doesn't determine how much an NPC in a game might offer a PC for their purchase. Just like all equipment has a specific value, the figures provided simply confer a baseline valuation for the purposes of comparing their worth against other items. NPCs may arrive at different valuations, be generous, be stingy, or be inclined to haggle as the GM sees fit. And, if an NPC becomes aware of the true function of the set, they may even be willing to offer even more to acquire it.</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Nesting Chests</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The true purpose of the Babushaboxes is more nefarious than one might realize.

If they instead slam the lid seven times, all six other boxes reappear stacked within it, although their contents is left precisely where it was when they were recalled.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The smaller Babushaboxes aren't without their own intrinsic value either. Should objects be placed in any Babushabox besides the master and their lid slammed a number of times equalling any other box in the set&mdash;starting with the smallest and ascending in order of size&mdash;these items reappear in that chest, as long as they fit.

Despite his swagger and charm, he was known to be a dreadful drunkard and was regularly intoxicated at the wheel. Conversely, he was applauded and highly sought-after for his ability to cut sharply between towering rocks, navigate crowded ports, and cleave through perilous storms at breakneck speeds. Unfortunately, his ship did eventually find ruin when he quit drinking and lost his nerve along with his stupor.

It is not, however, the result of the stout folks' ingenuity and hard work. Rather, this large gear is actually the product of human hands. It was once part of a great war machine, a wheel-mounted siege weapon so large that the missiles it fired were almost as large as the tree trunks from which they were formed. The war it was constructed for eventually came to an end and, after seeing it through dozens of clashes and skirmishes, </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">the crew that manned it stripped it down and each took a memento from it to keep for themselves. This sprocket is one such keepsake.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Sprocket of the Warmonger was a vital component of a siege weapon called the Warmonger.

On 1-5, you are unable to do so and lose 1 use of this ability for the day.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Stronger Together</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The crew of the Warmonger always managed to pull through whatever life threw at them, together. Whenever the game master calls for a group check, your party is considered to have 1 more member than it does and this additional individual automatically succeeds on its check, contributing to the total number of successes.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ammunition Retrieval</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">It's astounding how often a creature carrying the Sprocket of the Warmonger experiences minor feats of good fortune, especially when it comes to firing projectiles.

Returning from the island takes only 3 days, but a ship can only return to its point of origin. You can automatically plot a course to the island if you have Voyournal, while any creature that has been there before or has received directions to it can navigate to it with a DC 20 check using navigator&rsquo;s tools, with the island reappearing at the same location as before. This check is made with disadvantage if they're using secondhand directions. A creature that hasn&rsquo;t been to it before and hasn't been given directions by someone who has cannot chart a course to the island without the use of magic.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Secret Journal</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">A captain harbors many secrets in the course of their duties, and Voyournal can be trusted to safeguard them all.

{"name":"Javelin of Warning","permission":{"default":0,"IKZcSijaQ4XFwYDB":3,"OWUwMjUxOTE5MjE0":3},"type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">\"This javelin has a distinctive appearance thanks to the two very disparate, very unusual materials that are blended into its design. Its shaft is formed of exquisite red dalbergia wood that has been coated in a layer of shiny resin, while its handle and grip are constructed from pristine chrome that has been buffed until it sparkles. Between the two ultra-reflective materials, the whole javelin is left with a glistening sheen that reflects and radiates light. The juxtaposition between sleek, minimalist metal and wood</span></em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>&mdash;</em></span><em><span class=\"fontstyle0\">albeit very fine wood<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">&mdash;</span>is a strange mixture of the modern and the rustic, and the item seems striking if for that reason alone. That said, the javelin does have other unique qualities besides just the materials used in its construction, and it is thanks to these that its true significance is assured. For, although its role in the history books might be oft overlooked, this implement has been used to prevent many tragedies and travesties over the years, and has the potential to avert many more in the future.\"</span></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Weapon</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Javelin of Warning can be used as a javelin.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Message Compartment</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Javelin of Warning has a small receptacle built into its handle that is used for the purpose of storing letters, messages, and writs that have been rolled up. This compartment is 8 inches tall and has a circumference not exceeding the dimensions of the javelin itself. Objects weighing up to 1 pound can be interned in this chamber.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Modes of Operation</strong>. </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Javelin of Warning has 4 operating modes, which are activated in the following ways:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle2\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Screamer Mode.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If you twist its handle 90-degrees clockwise, the Javelin of Warning enters its Screamer mode. If the javelin is thrown skyward while in this mode, something occurs at the apex of its arc. What happens depends on whether it is day or night. During the day, the javelin emits a high-pitched sonic boom that can be heard out to a radius of 600 foot. During the night, the javelin looses a blinding flash of light that is visible out to a radius of 1,800 foot instead. Afterwards, the javelin returns to its Default mode and cannot reenter Screamer mode for 24-hours.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Seeker Mode.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you twist its handle 90-degrees counter-clockwise, the Javelin of Warning enters its Seeker mode. If the javelin is thrown into the air while in this mode, ethereal wings form around it during its flight and bare it away to a designated location within ten miles. In order for this mode to activate, you must have a suitable location in your mind&rsquo;s eye at the moment you throw it. When the javelin reaches its destination, it returns to its Default mode and cannot re-enter Seeker mode for 24-hours.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Sinker Mode.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you twist its handle 180-degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise, the Javelin of Warning enters its Sinker mode. If the javelin is placed into the ground, tip down, while in this mode, it arms itself after ten seconds. The next time that a Small or larger creature comes within 10 foot of the javelin, it burrows down into the ground and makes its way back towards you with a burrow speed of 30 foot if you&rsquo;re within twenty miles of its location, avoiding bedrock and stone formations along the way. When it has completed its journey, the Javelin of Warning returns to its Default mode and cannot re-enter Sinker mode for 24-hours.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Stealther Mode.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If you twist its handle 360-degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise, the Javelin of Warning enters its Stealther mode. While in this mode, the compartment built into the javelin&rsquo;s handle becomes flush with the rest of the item, making it less obvious. It requires a DC 18 Wisdom (perception) or 15 Intelligence (investigation) check to discover it. The Javelin of Warning returns to it&rsquo;s Default mode when a creature twists the handle 360-degrees back the way it came. This mode can be activated and de-activated any time, although the javelin's other modes cannot be activated until the object is reset to its Default mode.</span></li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Spoils of War","quantity":1,"weight":2,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Beginner Bauble","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":30,"long":120,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":"0","chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["1d6 + @mod","piercing"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"simpleM","properties":{"amm":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"hvy":false,"lgt":false,"lod":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"spc":false,"thr":true,"two":false,"ver":false},"proficient":false,"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"folder":"cWRjvnZeLQUNUCSA","sort":6800000,"flags":{"mess":{"templateTexture":"","isBonusDamage":false},"ddd-beginner-baubles":{"initialization-folder":"Beginner Baubles"}},"img":"modules/ddd-beginner-baubles/icons/simple-melee-weapon.png","effects":[],"_id":"vRsh82ogbFtBzLGO"}
